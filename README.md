# 🚀 VSD RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT – WEEK 2

Welcome to **Week 2** of my RISC-V Chip TAPEOUT journey! ✨
This week, I step deeper into the world of **System-on-Chip (SoC) design** 🖥️⚡. Through both **theory 📖** and **hands-on labs 🧪**, I explored the **VSDBabySoC** – a simplified yet powerful model built on the **RVMYTH Processor 🧠**, enhanced with IPs like a **PLL 🔄** and a **10-bit DAC 🎚️**.

The journey is organized into **two sub-branches**:

* 📖 **Theory** → focusing on the fundamental concepts of SoC design.
* 🧪 **Labs** → hands-on practice with open-source tools such as **Icarus Verilog 📝**, **GTKWave 🌊**, and **Yosys ⚙️** for simulation, waveform analysis, and synthesis.

At the end of the week, my goal is to **bridge these two branches together** — connecting theoretical understanding with **real-world semiconductor concepts** in an even more **refined, creative, yet professional way** 🌐💡.
